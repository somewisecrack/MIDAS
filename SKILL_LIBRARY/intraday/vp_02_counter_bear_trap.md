## 🛠️ Setup Rules

### Context
- Price must be **above EMA20** (bullish bias).

### Entry Trigger (Long)
1. A strong **red (bearish) candle** appeared in the last 10 bars — identify the largest-bodied red candle.
2. Current candle closes **green (bullish)**.
3. Current close is **above the close of that extreme red candle** (the bears were trapped).
4. Stop Loss = current candle's **Low**.

### Target
- 2× the risk distance.

## 💡 Notes
- Mirror of VP-01. Bears pushed price down hard, then price reversed above — shorts are trapped.
- Significantly weaker than the Bull Trap version. Only trade NIFTY 2m.
