## 🛠️ Setup Rules

### Context
- Price must be **below EMA20** (bearish bias).

### Entry Trigger (Short)
1. A strong **green (bullish) candle** appeared in the last 10 bars — identify the largest-bodied green candle in that window.
2. Current candle closes **red (bearish)**.
3. Current close is **below the close of that extreme green candle**.
4. Stop Loss = current candle's **High**.

### Target
- 2× the risk distance (1:2 R:R).

### Exit
- SL hit, target hit, or **3:15 PM** market close — whichever comes first.

## 💡 Notes
- Concept: Bulls pushed price up (green candle), but failed to continue. The trap is sprung when price falls back below that candle's close — institutions caught bulls on the wrong side.
- Works best with **high-volume** distribution candles.
- Avoid on strong uptrend days (when price is well above all EMAs).
