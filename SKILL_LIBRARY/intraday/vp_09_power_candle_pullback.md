## 🛠️ Setup Rules

**Power Candle**: body > 75% of total range AND range > 1.3× the 5-period rolling average range.

### Long Setup
1. A **bullish Power Candle** within the last 15 bars.
2. Price pulls back to **touch the Power Candle's low**.
3. Pullback candle: closes above the PC low + lower wick > body (rejection).
4. Entry = close. SL = current candle's low. Target = 2× risk.

### Short Setup
1. A **bearish Power Candle** within the last 15 bars.
2. Price rallies back up to **touch the Power Candle's high**.
3. Rejection: closes below PC high + upper wick > body.
4. Entry = close. SL = current candle's high. Target = 2× risk.

## 💡 Notes
- Power candles represent institutional moves — their lows/highs act as support/resistance on the pullback.
- Too many false signals on 2m for NIFTY and 5m for BANKNIFTY. Stick to 15m/2m as noted.
- Best combined with a Pivot or EMA level at the Power Candle's base for added confluence.
